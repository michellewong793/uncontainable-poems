title: The Graduation Speech That Never Was

([Link](http://thelowell.org))

Graduates, faculty, family and friends. Good evening, my name is Michelle. 

Today, I want to start by telling you guys a story about a very accomplished person in the audience right now. Sitting right in the crowd with us. 

She has a 4.7 GPA. 
She’s the President of four clubs, captain of three varsity sports. 
Took 15 AP tests by her senior year. 

She’s the perfect Lowell student. 
But as a very wise woman on broadcast news once said, Ain’t nobody got time for that. 

My friends, the perfect Lowell student, is only in our heads. They don’t exist. 

I hope the parents who were hoping this was their child have regained normal breathing patterns now. 

Throughout these four years, there’s no doubt that we’ve all felt the pressure to be something like this dream Lowell student. For some, this is motivating. 

But for others, the environment might just be the reason why you’re so excited to graduate. 

However the truth is, every single one of us is what makes this school so great. 

We’re friends, athletes, artists, musicians, dancers, speakers and maybe a combination of all, but we’re all part of the legacy that is Lowell High School. 
 
We’re just too cool for no school. 

Wellness Center pamphlets designed for us suggest that we only need half the amount of sleep that normal teenagers do to accomplish twice as much. 
College Board considers us so special that during a 3 hour long test, they don’t allow us to bring food or water because that’ll make us too powerful. 
We can also understand the unique schedule we have that changes from B-code to C-code to M-Code to Special-Code depending on the day, which is organized into mods, which are 15-minute subintervals and… I’ll leave the rest of the surprise for the incoming freshmen to find out about. 

Yep. We’ve got it together. 

The Class of 2015 is a truly diverse set of people, and that’s why my friend doesn’t exist. Lowell students expected way too much out of other Lowell students. We only have so much time to do what we love. 
But what one cannot possibly do all by themselves, a class can achieve together. We all make up a perfect graduating class, and today’s the day to celebrate that. 

Even though 7:30 a.m. math classes were still a little too early for appreciation, let’s be proud. Even though the girls bathroom stalls are still a little too short and we can get a little too close sometimes, let’s get closer. And even though you may never have spoken to that person next to you all these years, smile at them, take a picture and walk out of these halls with swag, dignity and unity because we truly were, all in this together. 

Except in Arena. All is fair in love, war and self-scheduling. 

Thank you faculty, family and friends for coming to celebrate with us on this special day. Congratulations Class of 2015, we did it! 
Let us keep in touch and forever hold onto the unique and memorable experience that we’ve shared together at Lowell High School.
