> Because I loved you without writing pseudocode, and I had no coverage  



be careful for who you give your heart to  
and if at all  
the problem for me though, is that I love binary  
which means if so, all, if not, not at all  
There is no in between.  
And if you ask me whether or not I checked my code before I submitted, I'll say no.  
Because I loved you without writing pseudocode, and I had no coverage  
I let you pass through the screenings, no rejection email, no ghosts  
None of that bullshit people call "dating"  
If you ask me if I loved you,  
I'll say yes.  
And if you asked me how much,  
I'll say 1.
